Tuesday 08/18/20: I was invited by a girl to the beach (maybe by pity) with friends of her. I felt already uncomfortable at the beginning because I arrived late so everyone was already setup. There were 4 girls and me. We were playing volley, everything goes, not really well yeah, until I oversaturate and just leave the sea and lay down on my towel shivering as hell for the rest of the afternoon :) and the girl does not text me anymore
